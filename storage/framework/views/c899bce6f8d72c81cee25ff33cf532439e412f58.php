                  <p class="psize">The deity of Lord Ganesha was incepted by Shri Dagdusheth Halwai and his wife Lakshmibai way back, when they lost their only son to the plague epidemic. Every year, the Ganpati festival was celebrated with deep faith and enthusiasm, not only by Dagdusheth’s family but the entire neighbourhood. Tatyasaheb Godse, then in his early youth, was a zestful participant in the celebrations. In later years, when Lokmanya Tilak made Ganpati festival a public celebration to bring people together for the freedom struggle, Dagdusheth Ganpati became the most respected and popular idol in Pune.</p>
                  <p class="psize">In 1952, the responsibility of organizing the festival at Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati temple officially fell upon Tatyasaheb and his group of friends. Under Tatyasaheb’s able guidance and leadership, his associates like Mamasaheb Rasane, Adv. Shankarrao Suryavanshi and K. D. Rasane planned and executed the festival with meticulous planning and professionalism, and since then, there was no looking back for them. As generous donors and devotees contributed towards the temple fund, Tatyasaheb and his friends thought what better way to worship the Lord than to serve our own fellow beings.</p>
                  <p class="psize">Soon, the young motivated group took the activities of the festival and the temple beyond traditional worship, into the domain of social and cultural development. Besides a rich religious schedule at the temple, they engaged in addressing the social and political problems of the state.</p>
                  <p class="psize">Today, by Lord Ganesha's blessings, Dagdusheth Halwai Sarvajanik Ganpati Trust has flourished into a veteran organization that is gratified to worship the Lord through its service to humanity.</p>

              <p class="psize">The architect Ar. Shri. Sharad Athale of SK Athale & Associates made an extensive survey of  temples in Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu. The  climatic conditions in both states are dry, hot and  semi arid for most parts of the year. However  considering the hot and humid climatic conditions,  heavy monsoon period for nearly 4 months and  proximity of the temple to the sea.</p>
              <p class="psize">The architects  came to conclusion that the Shiva Temple at Ambernath would be the ideal role model for this new temple. This Shiva Temple has a solid stone elevation and had faced local climatic condition admirably. Today, the Siddhivinayak temple has undergone a complete architectural transformation, thanks to the efforts of Ar. Shri. Sharad Athale of SK Athale & Associates.</p>
              <p class="psize">Keeping the idol intact, the temple has been built into unique multiangular, six storeyed structure, that reaches to the skies surmounted with a main central gold plated dome. The other small crowns that surround it are made of gold’s and panchadhatu (five metals). Three main entrances lead to the interior.</p>
              <p class="psize">The temples renovation commenced in 1990. It was completed in 3 years with an expense of Rupees three crores. The main stones used were marble and pink granite. The temple was designed to be a fine architectural example. Thus, a 200 year old temple was renovated and restored into a magnificent, multistoried and palace like temple.</p>
